	<ul>
		<li>A home page containing her Resume (Summary, Education, Professional Experience, etc.)</li>
		<li>A contact form allowing prospective employers to get in touch with the client</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Use Case: Contact by Prospective Employer</h2>
	<h3>Main Success Scenario</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Prospective employer lands on the web site's home page</li>
		<li>Prospective employer decides to contact the client</li>
		<li>Prospective employer follows link to contact information</li>
		<li>Prospective employer contacts the client</li>
	</ol>
