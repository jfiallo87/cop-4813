	<p>COP 4813 is reaching its end, and it's time to retrospect and
		look at what we've gained from this wonderful course. It's been a fun
		journey to prepare us in the pursuit of a web development career. I
		believe I can offer a unique perspective in this sense, having been a
		web developer for some years now; I can say with certainty that this
		is a very valuable class that would have definitely helped me at the
		beginning of my journey.</p>
	<p>The class covers some very important topics of client-side web
		development, like animation and form creation. These two make up a
		great part of the market share, including game development and
		business applications. I think the format of the class itself was
		quite illustrative of what you can expect from a professional
		environment, following an iterative process, and encouraging a climate
		of collaboration between the students.</p>
	<p>
		Having focused my career on the business applications branch of web
		development, I can say that the knowledge this class imparts upon the
		students is without doubt a great starting point. Moving forward my
		recommendation for the students that want to follow a similar path is
		to learn how to leverage professional javascript frameworks, in
		combination with architectural design patterns, because you're
		definitely going to make heavy use of these when you enter an
		enterprise development environment, which will feel like an scaled up
		version of this class. <a href="https://angularjs.org/"
			target="_blank">Angularjs</a> and <a
			href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">Reactjs</a>
		, along with the patterns they implement, are a great place to start.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the business world, the server-side is extremely important, it's
		what adds business value to web applications. In my view the market
		has been shifting for quite some time, and companies (specially those
		following agile development techniques) are very interested in
		full-stack developers. Even if UI is your focus, add a server side
		eco-system to your arsenal. <a href="http://spring.io/"
			target="_blank">Java + Spring Boot</a> is a very robust combination
		that is being used by some of the great companies out there (ex.
		Netflix).
	</p>
	<p>As a conclusion I'd like to reiterate my opinion that this has
		been a great class for anybody trying to get started in the career
		path of web development, I'd like to thank Dr. Eaglin for making this
		such a great opportunity, as well as a fantastic learning experience.</p>
